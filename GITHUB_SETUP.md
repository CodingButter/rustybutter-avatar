# Setting up a GitHub Repository for RustyButter Avatar

To set up a GitHub repository for this project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Enter "rustybutter-avatar" as the repository name
   - Add a description: "Avatar expression controller for OBS, with MCP integration for LLMs"
   - Choose if you want the repository to be public or private
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # Add the GitHub repository as the remote origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rustybutter-avatar.git
   
   # Push your local repository to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. If you want to use SSH instead of HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/rustybutter-avatar.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Check that your repository is properly set up:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

5. If you need to update the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rustybutter-avatar.git
   # OR for SSH
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/rustybutter-avatar.git
   ```

6. Verify everything worked by visiting your repository on GitHub.
